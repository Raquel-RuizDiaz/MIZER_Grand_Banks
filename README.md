# Grand Banks Multispecies Size Spectrum Model

This repository contains the code and outputs for a multispecies size-spectrum model of the Grand Banks of Newfoundland, developed using the mizer R package.
The model explores the ecological consequences of changing the biomass of key species (Atlantic cod, capelin, and sand lance), with a focus on predator-prey dynamics and community stability.
